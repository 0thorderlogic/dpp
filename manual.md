# Manual [WIP]

Specs are most commonly found in the data viewer however limited in it's database.

## Motor Input

- The codebase allows users to input as many motors as they might want. but defaults to **4 motos**

- Motor weight in **GRAMS** is needed, **weight of each motor**, can be found in the database or on the manufacturer website, but in my limited experience community is more reliable.

- How fast can the motor spin per volt (RPM/Volt). **Simply put higher the better.**

> KV is a scam but the only metric manufacturers care to publish

- Max Current (Amps each)
- Motor efficiency - default to around 75%
